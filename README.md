# Music Mood Classification

**Overview:**  
This repository implements a robust Music Mood Classification system that uses advanced audio features and machine learning to automatically tag songs with mood labels (e.g., "Mellow Acoustic ðŸŽ¶," "Powerful Calm ðŸ’¥," "Upbeat ðŸŽ‰," "Groovy Dance ðŸ’ƒðŸ•º"). Our approach combines unsupervised clustering (K-Means & Gaussian Mixture Models) with a high-performance neural network enhanced by feature engineering and cross-validation.

**Business Value:**  
- ** Precursor/Pipeline to the development of Personalized Recommendations:** Deliver mood-based playlists that keep users engaged.  
- **Efficient Content Curation:** Automate mood tagging for large music libraries, reducing manual effort and costs.  
- **Context-Aware Experiences:** Enable dynamic music selections for streaming, wellness, and brand marketing applications.

**Key Highlights:**  
- Extracts and engineers key audio features (valence, danceability, energy, etc.)  
- Combines crisp and fuzzy clustering techniques for nuanced mood detection  
- Achieves over 97% cross-validated accuracy with a tuned neural network

**Who Needs This:**  
Music streaming platforms, licensing agencies, retail/hospitality venues, and marketing firms can leverage this technology to enhance user experience and drive engagement.
